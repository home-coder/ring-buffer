/*Note, that initial anonymous mmap() can be avoided - after initial mmap() for descriptor fd, 
  you can try mmap() with hinted address as (buffer->address + buffer->count_bytes) and if it fails - 
  another one with hinted address as (buffer->address - buffer->count_bytes). 
  Make sure MAP_FIXED is not used in such case, as under certain situations it could end with segfault. 
  The advantage of such approach is, that it avoids requirement to map twice the amount you need initially 
  (especially useful e.g. if you want to use hugetlbfs and the allowed amount is limited) 
  and in context of gcc/glibc - you can avoid certain feature macros 
  (MAP_ANONYMOUS usually requires one of: _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE or _GNU_SOURCE).*/
